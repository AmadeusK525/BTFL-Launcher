## Beyond The Forbidden Lands

Beyond the Forbidden Lands is a non-profit fan-made PC remake of Shadow of the Colossus with the restoration of cut content as a major focus, including the Unused Colossi and removed areas from the game. The game provides the option of playing as close to the original Shadow of the Colossus as possible, along with the inclusion of a 'Story Mode' which is set before SotC.

## The Launcher

The game will be run through this launcher, which will mainly check for the validity of an iso of the original game and automatically search for updates. Without an original iso, the user will not be able to launch the game's executable.


NOTE: As of August 9th, 2021 all further development has been moved to the BTFLDev Fork.
